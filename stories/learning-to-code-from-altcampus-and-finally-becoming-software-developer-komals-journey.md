#### Here's the brief transcript of the conversation

<div className="transcript">

Komal Raj was about to join a Masters degree when her brother suggested to join AltCampus. But she was not sure that she would get a good job with great salary, without a masters degree, especially as a fresher. But her perspective changed soon.

After a week at AltCampus her confidence was boosted. And she realized that getting a job in any company needs skills first, rather than having a Bachelors or Masters degree, which is exactly what AltCampus is mainly focusing on.

She liked the mentorship and the community support which helped her to land her dream job within 6 months after joining AltCampus.

In comparison to a traditional college education, AltCampus is a far better way through which everyone can gain competitive skills and become job-ready
