          <p>
            The price of courses on AltCampus is based on a number of factors.
            Thus, AltCampus reserves the right to change the price of the
            courses depending on variation in such factors at its sole
            discretion. In certain instances, the price of a course displayed on
            AltCampus’s website may be different from what is displayed on
            AltCampus’s marketing material, due to changes in pricing systems
            and policies implementing sales and promotions of the courses. In
            case of such conflict, the prices mentioned in the website should be
            considered final.

            A user registering with AltCampus (‘User’) may have the option to
            opt for a Free Trial (as defined below) or pay the course fee at the

            (seven) days (‘Free Trial Window’) for the specified courses (‘Free
            Trial’). If free trial is available, the Free Trial Window shall

            granted to the User and shall expire after the expiration of 7
            (seven) days from the date of such access. Upon the expiration of
            the Free Trial Window, the access to the course will be terminated
            by AltCampus unless the User shall have made full payment associated
            with the courses (‘Course Fee’) to AltCampus. The Course Fee is as

            As stated above, the price may change depending on the policies of

            User logs in to account from the price available to Users who
            haven’t logged in or do not have an account with AltCampus, because
            some of AltCampus’s promotions may be available to only new Users.
