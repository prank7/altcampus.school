Before starting the MERN stack development course

- you should have a basic understanding of fundamental languages used by the browser and the server.
- You should be confident in designing and stlying web pages using HTML & CSS.
- Fundamental concepts of Javascript should be clear and should also be familier with DOM(Document Object Model) in browser.
- You should be able to work with unix based shell commands.
- Basic understanding of Node/express will speed up the learning process but is not recommended.

Here, I am going to list few fundamental concepts from Unix, HTML, CSS and Javascript for developers who want to start their journey as MERN Stack devs.

## 1. Unix Shell Commands

These are few unix commands which every developer should be familiar with. They help in adding, listing, navigating, editing and deleting files and folders through command line.

- ls
- cd
- cat
- mkdir
- rm/rmdir
- touch
- grep

## 2. HTML/ Fundamentals

- Introduction to Web and HTML & CSS
- Box Model
- Positioning
- Flexbox
- Typography
- Adding Media, Lists, Tables, Forms
- Responsive Web Design

## 3. Javascript Fundamentals

- Value, Variable and types
- Functions
- Data Structure (Arrays and Objects)
- Array and String methods
- Debugging & Chrome Developer Tools
- Introduction to DOM
- DOM and Events
- Higher order functions
- Scope & Closure

Once you have covered these topics then you can are ready to [learn entire MERN stack](https://altcampus.com/posts/the-complete-roadmap-to-learn-full-stack-web-development-using-the-MERN-stack).
