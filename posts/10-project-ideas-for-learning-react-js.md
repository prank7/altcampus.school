## 1. Layout to Components

Components are the most fundamental part of a React app. Having a good understanding of how to divide a layout into components is a very important skill to have as a React developer.

### What to do?

Re-create this layout ([live demo](https://altcampus.github.io/training-studio/)) using React by breaking it down into multiple components. You can get access to the HTML/CSS of the above demo using this [link here](https://altcampus.github.io/training-studio/). Clone the github repo and re-create it using React.

**Topics you will learn doing this:-**

- Breaking a layout down into components
- Understanding JSX
- Rendering elements to the DOM

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Time Taken:** 2 Hours

## 2. Button Component

You can make a component more powerful using props. Props are read-only pieces of information that you can pass to a component.

### What to do?

For this project, you will need to use props in your components. Using props you can add different properties to the component. Go through this [link](https://gist.github.com/nnnkit/2b3dafbce71756f2d26331fb2d90f06b), read the requirements and complete the project.

**Topics you will learn doing this:-**

- Making components powerful using props
- Using props
- Conditional rendering

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Time Taken:** 3 Hours

## 3. User Activity Tracker

This app can help a user to track their daily activities. It works like this:

- You can add a new activity
- Each activity will have **30** days to complete
- Each day represents if the task has been completed or not
- Select the day if you have completed it
- Unselect the day if you haven't
- Supports local storage

### What to do?

Creating an activity tracker will help you understand how to use state in React. Take a look at this project ([live demo](https://activity-tracker-xi.vercel.app/)) properly and re-create it using React. Don't forget to add **localStorage** support.

**Topics you will learn doing this:-**

- Managing state
- Conditional rendering
- Lifecycle methods

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Time Taken:** 4 Hours

## 4. TicTacToe Game

If you prefer to learn by doing you can follow [this](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) awesome tutorial. Just by following this tutorial you will understand all the basic concepts in React and can create this game.

### What to do?

Go through this [link](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), follow the instructions step-by-step and create the game. This tutorial will be a good recap of all React concepts - starting from setup, what is React, components, props, state and lifecycle methods etc. Completing this tutorial will give a huge boost to your confidence when making web apps using React.

**Topics you will learn by doing this:-**

- State
- Props
- Conditional rendering
- Lifecycle methods
- Lifting state up

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Time Taken:** 5 Hours

## 5. Memory Game

Making memory game will help you understand ways of managing compex state in React.

### What to do?
