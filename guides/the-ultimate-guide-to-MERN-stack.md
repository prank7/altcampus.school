Full Stack web development is gaining traction in IT industry as it allows developers to create a full fledged application from creating a simple web page to making it live on the internet. It requires knowledge of different technologies.

MERN stack which is powered by Javascript, allows developers to create Full stack applications without the knowledge of any other programming language.

This guide covers all the what, whys and hows required to start the MERN stack development.

### What does MERN stand for?

**MongoDB, Express.js, React.js & Node.js**

## What is MERN Stack ?

MERN is a **technology stack** used to develop a full-stack software application.

A technology stack is basically a set of frameworks and tools which facilitate the development of an application.

MERN stack laverages below frameworks/tools for creating full-stack applications:-

#### 1. **MongoDB**

- MongoDB is the database layer for the full-stack application used to store and manage data.
- It is an open-source, NoSQL, document based database which stores data in the binary JSON format.
- It is highly scalable and can be used to store latge volumes of data.

#### 2. **ExpressJS Framework**

- ExpressJS is an open source, unopinionated, lightweight framework built on top of NodeJS.
- It uses Javascript on the server side to create fast and secure back-end applications.
- You can use Model, View & Controller (MVC) pattern to create server-side applications.

#### 3. **ReactJS**

- React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library designed by Facebook.
- React is declarative, efficient and flexible for building user interfaces.
- It allows you to compose complex user interfaces from small and isolated, reusable pieces of code called **components**
- It is fast, scalable and offers code reusability.
- It uses JavaScript on the frontend platforms like browser, mobile applications etc.

#### 4. **NodeJS**

- Node.js is the back-end layer which hosts the server created using JavaScript.
- It is an open-source, cross-platform which uses JavaScript(outside the browser) to create server side tools and applications.
- Express.js framework is build on top of Node.js to facilitate web developments.
- Node.js hosts thousands of public/private packages via NPM to facilitate applications development over multiple domains.

### Why should you learn MERN Stack ?

- Using Javascript for both front-end and back-end reduces the learning time and cost as you don't need to learn any other language for separate client and server side applications.

- You can create full stack applications, mobile applications using React native, desktop applications using Electron.js - All you need is JavaScript.

- MongoDB as the database uses JSON(Javascript Object Notation) format to store and manage data which is standard now a days for exchange of information in a full-stack application from client to server and vice-versa, can be easily integrated in MERN Stack applications.

Here are [10 reasons why you should learn MERN stack.](https://altcampus.school/posts/why-should-you-learn-MERN-stack)

### Are there other tech stacks ?

Yes, there are other stacks as well. They may use languages other than Javascript.

- MEAN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & Node)
- MEVN Stack (Angular replaced by Vue.js)
- LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL & PHP)
- Rails + React.js and many more.

### Pre-requisites for learning MERN Stack

- Basic knowledge of Unix commands
- Good understanding of HTML/CSS concepts
- Grasp on JavaScript fundamentals
- Basics of mongoDB is a plus.

### Various layers of MERN Stack

![MERN stack architecture](https://i.imgur.com/Cxd49OJ.png)

<!-- <img src="./layers.png" style="width: 70%; float: center; padding: 20px;" /> -->

MERN Stack applictaions follows a 3 layer architecture pattern which is based on a typical MVC model.

#### 1. **Client layer(Views)**

- These are views(webpages) which is visible to the client.
- Client layer will be developed using React which combinely uses Javascript, HTML & CSS.
- On this layer, end users tries to access the feature of our application.

#### 2. **Application Layer(Controllers)**

- This is the business logic layer which is an Express application on top of Node.js platform.
- This application server acts as the bridge of communication between client & database layer.
- This layer accepts client's requests and serves them by fetching appropriate data from database layer.

#### 3. **Database Layer(Models)**

- Database layer runs the mongoDB server.
- All application data is stored in this mongoDB database.

### How does MERN Stack work ?

In a full-stack MERN application, the client layer(React application) which is accessible by the end users makes request for web pages. These requests go to the application server which is the logical layer. It determines what data/web-pages a client needs and makes request to database(database layer) for fetching those informtaion. Lastly the backend server(application layer) passes required data/web-pages to react application which renders the data on web-page for the clients.

Let's walk through a scenario to understand the working of MERN stack applications.

**Register user for an application**

- React application(client layer) displays a registration form on a webpage.
- End user fills the form and submits required data for registration.
- The user data is transferred from client to server(application layer) over http.
- Server receives the data and validates user's credentials.
- After validation, server sends user data to be saved into database(database layer).
- After success/failure confirmation from database, server sends a response to react over http.
- Based on success/failure, react application displays an appropraite message to client.

### Roadmap for learning MERN Stack and becoming a full stack developer

Remember, the core to become a full stack MERN developer is to have sound technical knowledge of underling languages like HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

There after, we can proceed to individual platforms/libraries based on the choosen stack.

A full-stack MERN developer should be prolofic in different technologies like

1. Frontend(React)
2. Backend(Node/Express)
3. Database Management(MongoDB)
4. Version Control(Git)
5. Operating Systems(linux/Mac/Windows)

Here's a [complete roadmap to learn and become a MERN stack developer](https://altcampus.school/posts/the-complete-roadmap-to-learn-full-stack-web-development-using-the-MERN-stack)

### How long it takes to learn MERN stack ?

It depends on the fundamental skill set. If you have sound technical knowledge of underlying languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript; it would take around 8-10 weeks to
become a beginner level MERN stack developer with hands-on practice.

1. Node.js Fundamentals(1 week)
2. ExpressJS & MongoDB Database(3-5 weeks)
3. React Fundamentals(2-3 weeks)

For understanding the advanced concepts of ReactJS like **Context API**, **State management using Redux** & **React hooks**, It may take additional 2 to 3 weeks.

If you are starting out the developer journey, you need to understand the fundamentals of web like HTML, CSS & Javascript.

It may take around additional 8-10 weeks to grasp the fundamentals.

1. HTML/CSS(3-4 weeks)
2. Javascript Fundamentals(3-4 weeks)
3. Javascript DOM(2 weeks)

So, in total it will take between 18-30 weeks to become a full-stack developer on MERN stack, starting from absolute scratch.

Our [program at AltCampus](https://altcampus.school) takes you all the way from zero to a full-stack employable MERN stack developer in about 6 months of time.

MERN Stack is build of 4 robust technologies i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node,js.

To be a MERN Stack developer, one should have working knowledge of all the above technologies.

Here's an article detailing [key concepts to learn in MERN Stack](https://altcampus.school/posts/key-MERN-stack-concepts).

### What are some MERN stack beginner projects that you can build to learn ?

While learning individual technologies(Node/Express, React), you can create small projects like -

- Todo App(Express)
- Photo Gallery(Express)
- Instagram clone(React)
- Movies catalog(React) etc.

to grasp smaller detailed concepts.

A MERN application involves both frontend and backend along with database to create a full stack application.

A full stack developer needs to figure out the UI, create backend APIs which can serve data to fronend application, integrate it with the database for managing application data, think of different ways data could be saved for faster processing and all possible CRUD applications.

Few full stack MERN projects which a beginner developer can start with are:

#### 1. Personal Project Management Tool

- This project can help you gather all your learning projects in one app. You can use MongoDB database for storing all project details like project name, details, url link, github repository etc...
- Using React, create webpages where you can list all the projects.
- Express application linked to mongoDB database can serve data to React application

#### 2. Public Blog App

Create a blog application where users can

- Login/Signup to the application
- Create articles
- View list of all the articles
- Edit/Delete his/her own articles
- Add categories, tags and filters to list blog page
- Follow other article authors
- Favorite/like articles
- Add comment to the articles

#### 3. Social Media App for local handicrafts

Social media app where people can connect with other people, view local handicrafts being created in the area, share their own creatings etc.

### Is MERN stack production ready and scalable ?

Yes, MERN stack is production ready as well as massively scalable.

You can deploy a full-stack MERN application easily on all big platforms like AWS, DigitalOcean as well as heroku(for small applications).

You can even deploy them indivisually as frontend(React App) and Backend(Express App) separately on these platforms.

They even have managed services exclusively for deploying Node/React based applications.

MongoDB database which is used to store MERN stack application data is massively scalable as it can scale horizontally by adding multiple database servers as per application requirements.

MongoDB also supports replication which can provide high availability of data all the time.

### MERN stack vs MEAN stack ?

MEAN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & Node
MERN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, React & Node

Both uses Javascript language for different technologies(frontend & backend) to create Full stack applications.

The difference is:

- MEAN Stack uses AngularJS for creating frontend UIs
- MERN Stack uses ReactJS in place of AngularJS for frontend UIs.

There are other differences as well:-

- Angular uses Typescript language for UI whereas React uses mostly Javascript and JSX sometimes. A full stack MERN developer uses Javascript at all the places and context switching between frontend and backend becomes smooth and easy.

- Angular is a tightly coupled framework with different versions which requires you to understand each parts, hence a steep learning curve. On the other hand React is an open source library composed of small, reusable Javascript components which is easy to learn. React documentation is a great help for beginner React learners as it is clear and consize.

- React uses virtualDOM which facilitates smooth rendering and it also enforces minimal chages in the UI based on the changed state by comparing virtualDOM with actual rendered component. It helps application to render only the thing which is changed from previous page.

- React offers better productivity compared to Angular as we can easily create small, reusable components once and use it multiple times in same or other applications.

- Angular has bidirectional data flow which in case of larger applications makes it harder to track the source of data changes. There would be a lot of actions which would mutate data all the times. In React, data flow is unidirectional and only certain actions can change the data present in the store. This will save the data from unnecessary mutations and it can be easily tracked.

- React is more suited for Native mobile app development whereas we can use Angular for this.

According to the 2019 HackerRank Developer skills report, Angular was the most popular choice of a web framework that programmers knew in 2018. This changed in 2019, the same report found that 30% of developers in 2019 wanted to learn the React framework, making it the most popular.

The lack of backward compatibility between Angular 2 and Angular 1 seems to have adversely impacted the popularity of Angular as both have their own learning curve.

React on the other hand is gaining widespread popularity among developers in 2021. It supports easy integration with other Javascript libraries and modules and has better community support than Angular.

That's a wrap up on the ultimate guide to MERN stack. Happy learning.
